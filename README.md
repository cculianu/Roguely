# SDL2 Roguelike (needs new name)

A port of my BlazorRoguelike to SDL2 and C++

## Status

The current map is just a big room with an outer wall and randomly spawned 
walls inside. Enemies spawn, move around and you can attack them to increase
your score. You can pick up health gems and coins. Dead enemies spawn a 
treasure chest with a chance to increase health and score.
