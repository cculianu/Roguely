# SDL2 Roguelike (needs new name)

A port of my BlazorRoguelike to SDL2 and C++

## Status

The current map is just a big room with an outer wall and randomly spawned 
walls inside. Enemies spawn, move around and you can attack them to increase
your score. You can pick up health gems and coins. Dead enemies spawn a 
treasure chest with a chance to increase health and score.

## Tileset

I've included the Photoshop file that was used to create the tileset. My 
workflow is to develop tiles in 8x8 and then upscale them to 32x32 and then 
export the tileset as a PNG which is used in the game.
